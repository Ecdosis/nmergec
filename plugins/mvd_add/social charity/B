Social Charity
Tis Life's prime household wisdom not to scorn
An erring Friend too sternly. If but tried
Severely in some weakness, all will turn
To folly sometimes,—and Love's cheek be dyed
With blushes such as for the fallen burn:
So much, even in the best is there to mourn.
And knowing this, we should be sadly kind,
Not cruel, in reproof, nor sourly churn
Sin into madness. Though in One we find
Those gems of worth, high motives, feelings strong,
Set in the fine gold of a constant mind?
Yet even that one's prone to starts of wrong
As ever: in the clearest well their lies
A sediment—disturb it, and 'twill rise.
