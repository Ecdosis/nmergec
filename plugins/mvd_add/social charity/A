Social Charity
Tis Life's prime household wisdom, not to scorn
An erring Friend too bitterly. If tried
Severely in some weakness, all will turn
To folly sometimes,—till Love's cheek be dyed
With blushes, such as for the fallen burn:
So much there is, even in the best to mourn.
And knowing this, we should be sadly kind,
Not cruel, in reproof, nor sourly churn
Sin into madness. Though in One we find
Those gems of worth, pure feelings and high parts,
Set in the fine gold of a constant mind?
Yet even that one subject is to starts
Of evil: in the clearest well thus lies
A sediment—disturb it, and 'twill rise.
