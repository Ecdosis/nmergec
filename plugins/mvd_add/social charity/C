Social Charity
Tis Life's prime household wisdom not to scorn
An erring Friend too grimly. If but tried
Severely in some weakness, all will turn
To folly sometimes,—and Love's cheek be dyed
With blushes such as for the fallen burn:
So much, even in the best is there to mourn.
And knowing this, we should be sadly kind,
Not cruel, in reproof, nor sourly churn
Sin into madness. Though in One we find
Those gems of worth, high motives, feelings pure,
Set in the fine gold of a constant mind?
Yet even he shall sometimes prove insure:
So: in the clearest fountain their lies
A sediment—disturb it, and 'twill rise.
